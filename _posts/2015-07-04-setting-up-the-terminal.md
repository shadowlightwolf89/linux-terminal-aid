---

In this post I'll be writing about how I, at least, set up my terminal for the first time, if you've already got your terminal set up just the way you like it, you can probably skip this, or you can read it to find out how other's might set theirs up.

I'll probably update this post later, with more details.

To begin, I install [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) and [antigen with oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen).

Once, I've gotten those set up, I start installing a few antigen plugins, I won't bore you by listing all of them.

After I'm done listing them all in my .zshrc file, I restart my terminal so that antigen can install those plugins, then I set about installing [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [hub](https://hub.github.com/), followed by [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build).
