I've updated the blog to include a special 404 page, it's not Linux related thoug, it's actually for windows, since it's a Blue Screen of Death. Also, just wanted to remind people that I'll be gone for 30 days starting tomorrow due to the fact that I'm moving.

I hope to be back as soon as that 30 days are up, so wait for me will ya?
