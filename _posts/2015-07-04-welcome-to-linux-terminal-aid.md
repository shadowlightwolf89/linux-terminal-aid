Hey! Welcome to my blog, I hope you like the design, I may not have written it from scratch, but I did modify it, and whew it took a while to get it right.

Actually, that's part of why I'm writing this blog, because sometimes, you just need to know the right terminal command to get things to work.

This post is not only an introduction, it's a how-to for the site! If you want to learn about something specific, try checking out a category or tag, it's easy enough, since I'll be sure to categorize things properly, and tag everything.

Anyways, I hate to create and run, but I've got packing to do, I'm moving on the 6th, and I'm afraid I won't have internet for 30 days thereafter.
