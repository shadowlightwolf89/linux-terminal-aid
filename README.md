# What is this?
This is my attempt at making something useful, not only to myself (I'm always forgetting how things are done, or needing to google how to do something ), but for others as well. This is a repository of knowledge, a wealth of tips, tricks, and tutorials on how to use the Linux Terminal. I might extend it to include the Windows Bash and Powershell terminals someday, but meh.
